# Work With AI

After have some try, I think it the time to change the repo purpose.
The reason is previous repo just try to focuse on QA/Software Testing, But now in AI Age,
It should be about create project and coding leverage existing framework, open source repo, and AI related projects
to build various real projects in a shocking pace.

So this repo is about building various real projects in a shocking pace:

1. Collection of Docker-Compose or self setup script for easy setup your working environment.
2. Collection of Self-Made projects leveraging existing framework, open source repo, and AI related projects

And also I changed my mind about just collect docker images files, but from real project to collect infra script from time to time.

## QA/Software Testing

- [] QA Testing Management System
- [] QA Automation Framework
- [] QA API Recording Tools

## Self Stacks For Dev/QA/Startup

A Collection of Docker-Compose or self setup script for easy setup your working environment.
It is not only for Dev but also for Software QA,Project Management,or startup company.

Most of cases are used in my daily work, and it works pretty well in both a small startup company and my
daily work.

## Database-BI Infrastructure

Recommendation:

1. Database: Postgresql works well in almost all the cases.
2. Database/Backend Service: Supabase rocks, easy to setup and API exposed directly after data is ready
3. BI: metabase is easy to setup,use or compose different dashboards

Docker/Docker-compose/Run Scripts:

- [X] [supabase](./database/supabase/docker/docker-compose.yaml)Database and Backend as Service
- [X] [metabase](./database/bi/metabase/docker/docker-compose.yaml)Metabase BI Dashboard
- [X] [Postgresql](./database/postgresql/docker-compose.yaml) postgresql database
- [X] [Duckdb](./database/duckdb/docker-compose.yaml)timeseries duck db
- [X] [timescale](./database/timescale/docker-compose.yaml)timescale database
